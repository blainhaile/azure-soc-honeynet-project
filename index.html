    <h1>SOC and Honeynet in Azure</h1>
    <p>This cybersecurity lab in Azure aims to demonstrate the creation of a honeynet and the operation of a Security Operations Center (SOC) to identify and remediate vulnerabilities. The lab involves building a vulnerable environment, simulating attacks, collecting and analyzing logs using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, visualizing the data, detecting incidents, and performing basic incident response. Here is a breakdown of the lab components and steps:</p>

    <h2>1. Environment Setup in Azure</h2>
    <p>Azure Subscription: The lab starts with an Azure subscription, which can be a free trial or a pay-as-you-go account.</p>
    <p>Resource Groups: Resources are organized into resource groups like RG lab for the main lab components and RG attacker for the attacker machine.</p>
    <p>Virtual Machines (VMs):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Windows VM: A Windows virtual machine is created in the RG lab resource group. It is configured with at least two vCPUs for performance. An administrator account (lab user) with a password is created.</li>
        <li>Linux VM: A Linux (Ubuntu Server) virtual machine is also created in the same RG lab resource group and virtual network (lab vnet). It uses the same lab user credentials for simplicity.</li>
        <li>Attacker VM: A separate Windows virtual machine is created in a new resource group RG attacker and a new virtual network. It also uses the lab user credentials. This VM is intended to simulate attacks from a potentially different geographical location (although in this lab it was created in the same region).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet</h3>
    <p>A virtual network named lab vnet is created to host the initial VMs.</p>
    <p>Network Security Groups (NSGs): NSGs act as firewalls in Azure. Initially, a dangerous rule is added to the NSGs associated with both the Windows and Linux VMs to allow any inbound traffic from any source to any destination, making them highly vulnerable. This is done specifically to generate attack logs.</p>
